## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-comment.mp4 -->

## Features

- Commenting in Normal mode respects `v:count` and is dot-repeatable.
- Comment structure is inferred from 'commentstring': either from current buffer or from locally active tree-sitter language. It can be customized via `options.custom_commentstring`.
- Handles both tab and space indenting (but not when they are mixed).
- Allows custom hooks before and after successful commenting.
- Configurable options for some nuanced behavior.

Notes:

- To use tree-sitter aware commenting, global value of 'commentstring' should be `''` (empty string). This is the default value, so make sure to not set it manually to a different value.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.comment').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Options which control module behavior
  options = {
    -- Function to compute custom 'commentstring' (optional)
    custom_commentstring = nil,

    -- Whether to ignore blank lines when commenting
    ignore_blank_line = false,

    -- Whether to ignore blank lines in actions and textobject
    start_of_line = false,

    -- Whether to force single space inner padding for comment parts
    pad_comment_parts = true,
  },

  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    -- Toggle comment (like `gcip` - comment inner paragraph) for both
    -- Normal and Visual modes
    comment = 'gc',

    -- Toggle comment on current line
    comment_line = 'gcc',

    -- Toggle comment on visual selection
    comment_visual = 'gc',

    -- Define 'comment' textobject (like `dgc` - delete whole comment block)
    -- Works also in Visual mode if mapping differs from `comment_visual`
    textobject = 'gc',
  },

  -- Hook functions to be executed at certain stage of commenting
  hooks = {
    -- Before successful commenting. Does nothing by default.
    pre = function() end,
    -- After successful commenting. Does nothing by default.
    post = function() end,
  },
}
```
